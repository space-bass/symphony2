# symphony2
I started and lost three drafts of my first symphony (which shall remain unfinished) to various hardware failures (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNZ4qjMn-GHoez6_PtpyJfcU_ialTS8bB&feature=shared) (https://gizmodo.com/how-can-a-hard-drives-platter-shatter-without-evidence-5215743) and evidently the first and so far only draft of my second symphony (so named for the purpose of superstition) which had intentionally been handwritten and stored in a locked room at my university, was also just lost to a presumed summer custodial sweep so I think I'm just an idiot.

This is more an exercise in learning the functions of GitHub and how they can be practically applied to the arts, specifically classical music composition. Programmers with musical knowledge and musicians with programming knowledge are very welcome, as well as those without any knowledge of either.
